            <p>
                Around the United States, millions of loving animals spend their whole lives in bouncing between adoption shelters and foster homes. Many interested potential owners are out there, hoping to provide loving homes, but struggle with the process of searching for their perfect companion. Shelters often rely on patient, compassionate volunteers, but are often over-crowded, under-funded, and under-staffed. Simply caring for the animals is already plenty to handle, and they often need help with outreach.

                <em>Forever Home</em> is here to help! We provide a free service with the mission to help connect adoption agencies with interested customers. We want to help more pets spend long, happy lives while bringing joy to loving families.

Once submitted, you'll be able to view the information for each animal listing, monitor their adoption status, or edit the listing as needed. You'll also be able to view any pending applications and contact any interested customers.
